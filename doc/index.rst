Hydra Platform is an open-source model platform for network based data
management. It facilitates the development of complex resource network models by
providing a consistent storage facility for network topology and associated
datasets. Hydra Platform is built around a server that exposes all functionality
as a web service to which Apps can connect to access data.


User Interfaces

Any organisation can build their own user-interface for Hydra.
The University of Manchester offers `hydra.org <https://www.hydra.org.uk>` as a free online user
 interface to allow building river basin simulation models.


Development team
